   Welcome to our brand new MAC x Collab 
  Stuck at home but still want improve your technical skills?

  MAC is kicking off our weekly collaboration sessions aimed at giving you the
  opportunity to build your own projects while learning with others.

  These sessions will vary depending on the rotation and will range from a
  student teaching other students, to a group of students following tutorials
  together online. The ultimate goal is to be able to create a final project!
   Our First Session is a Website Redesign! 
  Often, you will look at a website and find that it looks good but realise you
  are unable to explain why.

  Our Marketing Director Jasmine Bañares (https://cutt.ly/meet-jasmine) will be
  giving an overview of what User Experience is, and then move on to the
  hands-on part of the workshop which is the website redesign!

  She will be talking about what makes a website "good" by going through some
  important UX principles and how to apply them. She will also walk through the
  website design process as well as the reasoning behind certain design
  decisions.

  For the second part of the workshop, you will be getting your hands dirty by
  re-designing a website using Adobe Illustrator (currently free for students!).
  It should be noted that the process can be done using other softwares or
  tools. However, for the purposes of the workshop we would like to request that
  everyone has Adobe Illustrator installed and ready to run!

  If you've ever wanted to learn about the hands-on nitty gritty stuff in
  website design, tune in to learn more!

  This is also a special mention to FIT1050 and FIT3175 students. The first
  major assignment for FIT1050 will be on a website redesign – join us to learn
  about how and what principles you should be adopting in your work. For FIT3175
  students, feel free to come along and learn how to use Adobe design tools to
  create your mockup.

  graphics that you see in MAC!)
